Scraped more than 4000 digital images of faces with and without mask from google with Python stack. Leveraged OpenCV & CNN techniques to analyze and shape the dataset. Established a predictive model to categorize a face as mask or no-mask to help companies determine if employees or customers were following guidelines and avoiding negative PR and penalty fines.
