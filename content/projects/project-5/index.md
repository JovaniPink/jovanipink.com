Interests are data analysis and data engineering to drive us to better outcomes. Past experience in front-end development work, quality assurance code testing, data analytics and visualization. In my work through UCFâ€™s Data Analytics & Visualization Boot Camp, we need extensive knowledge of Data Analysis platforms and creating narratives with data. We are given case studies to work through and are tasked to detect patterns and produce a reporting analysis in line with KPIs. Check out my work!
