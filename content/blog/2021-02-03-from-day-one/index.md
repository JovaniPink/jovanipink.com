<br />
The ending sentences quoted above were awesome, for the reason of championing invention for being the root of their success. I agree with Mr. Bezos that the process of introducing and executing new methods, ideas, or products; the innovation process, can make work fun and meaningful. However, normally a root is not outside of healthy soil, just as the innovative process isn’t normally done outside of a healthy social environment.

   <strong>Leadership or followership for health innovation.</strong>

My associative thinking mind started running after reading Jeff Bezos’ email to reflect on my past experiences. What first came to mind was the past work that came out of Google that was captured nicely in Charles Duhigg’s NY Times article [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?smid=url-share):
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
 <p>The idea that stood out to me was, “Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.”</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
My thoughts became clearer reflecting on the book "The Culture Code'' by Daniel Coyle. A book that captures the **leadership skills** to harness a healthy innovation environment, summed up from Coyle:
<br />
<br />
**First, practice empathy and “Build Safety” in your system to where it is ok to provide feedback regardless of status or role.**
<br />
**Second, “Share Vulnerability” describes how “habits of mutual risk drive trusting cooperation.” Fundamentally we were created and nurtured for relationships for the purpose of building up.**
<br />
**Third, by building a shared culture that clearly defines the group’s purpose, goals, values, and functions we “Establish Purpose."**
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>
   <strong>Innovation and culture.</strong>
  </p>
<br />
Jeff’s leadership fostered the culture from Day 1 that contributed to Amazon’s success. I share in his excitement for “inventiveness” but I want to add it’s in the context of a culture that lets people, keep on inventing, get past that despair when at first the idea looks crazy to peers, empower wonder and curiosity. Yes, it’s a champion invention, but it’s also what Google found out “In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs” and in one way a leader that tries to practice Daniel Coyl’s leadership skills.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Understand. Innovate. Empathize. Create. Repeat.
