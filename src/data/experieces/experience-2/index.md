I’ve revamped web UI interfaces for customer-facing small business and organization sites. Designed and developed front-end code, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, Node scripts. My focus on selling my services to companies was developing these small minimum viable products that gave a glimpse of what the new site designs, or feature, or site tweak could bring value to the user. All projects were managed through GitHub, Slack, and Basecamp. Communication with clients is crucial in their satisfaction within business dealings. As much as I focused on product quality – I focused on effective and kind communication.
